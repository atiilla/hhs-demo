              <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground">
                Defining hacking can be challenging due to its variable nature. However, a common trait among many hackers is their playful, intelligent, and exploratory mindset. Thus, hacking means exploring the boundaries of what is possible with a playful spirit. Activities that demonstrate playful intelligence have hack value.
