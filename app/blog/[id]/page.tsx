    title: "Building an Open Source Drone from Scratch",
    excerpt: "A step-by-step guide to building your own autonomous drone using open source hardware and software.",
    content: `
      <p>Building your own drone is an exciting project that combines hardware, software, and a bit of creativity. In this guide, we'll walk through the process of creating an autonomous drone using open source components.</p>
      
      <h2>Materials You'll Need</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Flight controller (e.g., Pixhawk, ArduPilot)</li>
        <li>Drone frame</li>
        <li>Motors and ESCs</li>
        <li>Propellers</li>
        <li>Battery and power distribution board</li>
        <li>Radio transmitter and receiver</li>
        <li>Optional: GPS module, telemetry radio, camera</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Step 1: Assembling the Frame</h2>
      <p>Start by assembling your drone frame according to the manufacturer's instructions. Most frames come with detailed assembly guides. Make sure all connections are secure and the frame is balanced.</p>
      
      <h2>Step 2: Installing Motors and ESCs</h2>
      <p>Mount the motors to the arms of your frame and connect them to the electronic speed controllers (ESCs). The ESCs should then be connected to your power distribution board.</p>
      
      <h2>Step 3: Setting Up the Flight Controller</h2>
      <p>Install your flight controller in the center of the frame, making sure it's oriented correctly. Connect the ESCs to the appropriate outputs on the flight controller.</p>
      
      <h2>Step 4: Installing Radio Receiver and Optional Components</h2>
      <p>Connect your radio receiver to the flight controller. If you're using additional components like GPS or telemetry, install these as well.</p>
      
      <h2>Step 5: Software Configuration</h2>
      <p>Download the appropriate firmware for your flight controller (e.g., ArduCopter for ArduPilot-based controllers). Use Mission Planner, QGroundControl, or a similar ground control station to configure your drone's parameters.</p>
      
      <h2>Step 6: Calibration and Testing</h2>
      <p>Calibrate your accelerometer, compass, and radio. Perform a motor test to ensure all motors are spinning in the correct direction. Start with a simple hover test in a safe, open area.</p>
      
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>Once your drone is flying reliably, you can start exploring autonomous features like waypoint missions, return-to-home functionality, and even computer vision for obstacle avoidance.</p>

    title: "Machine Learning for Beginners: A Practical Introduction",
    excerpt: "Learn the basics of machine learning with practical examples and code snippets you can use right away.",
    content: `
      <p>Machine learning might seem intimidating at first, but with the right approach, anyone can start building models and making predictions. This guide will introduce you to the fundamentals with practical examples.</p>
      
      <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
      <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Instead of writing rules, you provide data and the algorithm finds patterns.</p>
      
      <h2>Types of Machine Learning</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Training with labeled data (e.g., classification, regression)</li>
        <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Finding patterns in unlabeled data (e.g., clustering)</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Learning through trial and error with rewards</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Getting Started with Python</h2>
      <p>Python is the most popular language for machine learning. You'll need libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and potentially TensorFlow or PyTorch.</p>
      
      <pre><code>
# Install necessary libraries
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

# Import libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
      </code></pre>
      
      <h2>A Simple Linear Regression Example</h2>
      <p>Let's predict house prices based on size:</p>
      
      <pre><code>
# Sample data: house size (sqft) and price ($)
sizes = np.array([1400, 1600, 1700, 1875, 1100, 1550, 2350, 2450, 1425, 1700])
prices = np.array([245000, 312000, 279000, 308000, 199000, 219000, 405000, 324000, 319000, 255000])

# Reshape for scikit-learn
sizes = sizes.reshape(-1, 1)

# Split into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(sizes, prices, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print(f"Coefficient: {model.coef_[0]}")
print(f"Intercept: {model.intercept_}")

# Visualize results
plt.scatter(sizes, prices, color='blue', label='Actual prices')
plt.plot(sizes, model.predict(sizes), color='red', label='Predicted prices')
plt.xlabel('House Size (sqft)')
plt.ylabel('Price ($)')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
      </code></pre>
      
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <p>After mastering the basics, you can explore:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>More complex algorithms like Random Forests and Neural Networks</li>
        <li>Feature engineering to improve model performance</li>
        <li>Cross-validation for better evaluation</li>
        <li>Hyperparameter tuning to optimize your models</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Machine learning is a vast field with endless possibilities. Start small, experiment often, and keep learning!</p>
